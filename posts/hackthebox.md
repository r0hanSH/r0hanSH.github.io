# HackTheBox writeups
15-01-2020

Few weeks ago, I came across [this post](https://techryptic.github.io/2018%2F08%2F02%2FHackTheBox-%28HTB%29-thoughts-as-Guru-Rank%2F) which really motivated me to get back to HackTheBox(HTB). So I spent last 30 days on htb to brush up my skills. I solved 21 machines(19 active and 2 retired) and few challenges.

The write-ups are password protected with their respective root flags. Basically, these are my ```notes.txt``` that I made while I was working on those machines and may not contain full information but have necessary steps to pwn the machine.

So this is the end of my journey on HTB and now I will take a break from CTFs as campus placements are approaching ðŸ˜‘

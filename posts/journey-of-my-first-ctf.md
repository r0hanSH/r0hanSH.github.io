# Journey of my first CTF (InCTF 2018)

Note : This blog post is all about my experience at InCTF 2018 and writeup of few challenges. There were two rounds : InCTF quals (Jeopardy) and InCTF finals (Attack-Defense style). It was organised by India's #1 and World's #35 CTF team as per ctftime.org ratings of 2018.

I have been playing wargames regularly, but never get a taste of CTFs. On 05/12/18 one person sent a message in a WhatsApp group and talked about InCTF that it's really good and blah blah... I google it and got to know about team bi0s. They are great people, once you meet them you will know how smart they are.

It was a team event, only Indian universities/colleges can take part in it. Team members can be in range of 3 to 5. Some guys of my university registered, so I asked one of them that how many members do your team have? But he was offline at that time. At that moment, I was afraid as I have no team to participate with. So I registered as an individual. But next thing was, how can a single person compete with team have 3-5 elite hackers. Let's give it a try.

The InCTF Online quals lasts for 36 hours. I was able to solve all forensics problems (3), 1 pwn, 2 crypto and 2 Web. So I got 6th position. It was good for me. If I were in a team, I know we can do much better.

## InCTF Finals Call

As I said the finals criteria was having a team of 3-5 members and only top 30 teams will be called for onsite Attack-Defense style CTF. So I thought I have no chance to be in finals. So I messaged InCTF on facebook and told that I played CTF individually and asked whether I am qualified for finals or not. Next day evening, I got phone call from organisers and they asked for solutions of the forensics challenges. So now I explained them everything that what was my methodology and how I did it all. Even I asked him that are you having any doubt about me? He said no, we just ask some of participants for confirmation. After 1 hour, I got another call from them and they asked for solutions of crypto challenges. So again I explained everything and again asked him, are you having doubt about me? and this person said something very nice that motivated me for finals. He said, we were amazed how a single person can solve so many problems in such less time. I was happy about it. He appreciated me and it was nice to hear that. On 14/12 I left for Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kayankulam, Kerala.


## InCTF Finals (day 1)

I was the first person to arrive there. It was 3-days event from 18/12 to 20/12. On 18/12, we were having workshops related to RE, BE, Web exploitation, Crypto and Forensics. As I played CTF individually, so on 17/12 organisers asked me to join any other team having one slot vacant. As in Attack-Defense style CTF, playing individually will be really tough. Even I know, I will not be able to manage services, check network activity, patch vulnerabilities, attack others and automate stuff at the same time. So I joined team nullsec. So there is no team CLS from Lovely Professional University, it was CLS playing with nullsec under team name nullsec. I felt bad at that time thought when I will come back to university, I will make an academic CTF team like team bi0s.



## InCTF Finals (day 2) and VMware CTF

On 19/12, we were told that there will a VMware CTF and one professional from NTRO will be observing you while hacking. There were 5 problems from each domain of cyber security. Those who solve any one problem will get job or internship offer from VMware. Cognizant and Netcon also called students who qualified for finals, for job opportunities.  But these offers were only for 3rd year and 4rth year students. So no luck for me, as I am a 2nd year student. But I gave it a try and you can check the writeup for Forensics challenge [here](https://r0hansh.github.io/posts/InCTF-and-VMware-CTF.html). Although, I got some appreciation from fellow hackers. When other teams came to know that I was the only player in my team. They gave me names like "one man army", "forensics guy" etc. People came to me to know how I solved all forensics challenges in quals round and shared some tricks with them.


## InCTF Finals (day 3)

On 20/12, we were having our Attack-Defense style CTF. It was a great event. But to excel in A-D CTFs, you need a really good team and most importanly team coordination which our team lacked and we ended up 7th on the scoreboard but with highest SLA. If you need any tips regarding A-D style CTF, you can mail me.


# Motive of this post

So now you have read how I suffered when I didn't have a team. It will be really great to grow with a team. So I am looking forward to create academic CTF of LPU, if you want to join or you have some recommendations please let me know. That's also the main reason I started writing blog to have digital presence and signed up a new twitter account as [r0hansh](https://twitter.com/r0hanSH). If you want to know more about me or my achievements, you can mail me anytime.

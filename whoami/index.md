# **WHOAMI**

### A CTF player who is currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Lovely Professional University, Phagwara. I'm really passionate about web exploitation, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, forensics and steganography. I had played a lot of wargames like webhacking.kr, reversing.kr, bandit, pwnable.kr, narnia etc. I had also found RCEs in real-world applications.
